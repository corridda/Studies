"""sum(iterable[, start])"""
# https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/sum

"""Sums start and the items of an iterable from left to right and returns the total. 'start' defaults to 0.
The iterableâ€™s items are normally numbers, and the start value is not allowed to be a string.
For some use cases, there are good alternatives to sum(). The preferred, fast way to concatenate
a sequence of strings is by calling ''.join(sequence). To add floating point values with extended precision,
see math.fsum(). To concatenate a series of iterables, consider using itertools.chain().

# Example: How sum() function works in python?

numbers = [2.5, 3, 4, -5]

# start parameter is not provided
numbersSum = sum(numbers)
print(f"numbersSum: {numbersSum}")

# start = 10
numbersSum = sum(numbers, 10)
print(f"numbersSum: {numbersSum}")
