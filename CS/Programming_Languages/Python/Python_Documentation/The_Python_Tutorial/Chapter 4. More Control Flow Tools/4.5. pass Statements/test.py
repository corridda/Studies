# The pass statement does nothing.
# It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action.

# while True:
#     pass

# This is commonly used for creating minimal classes:
class MyEmptyClass:
    pass

# Another place pass can be used is as a place-holder for a function
def empty_func():
    pass
