"""EXERCISE 3.16. SIFTING THROUGH XOR
XOR together some plaintext messages and look around for patterns and readable data.
There’s no need to use any encryption for this, just take some regular, human-readable
messages and XOR the bytes. Try human-readable strings, XML, JSON, and other formats. You
may not find a lot that is instantly decipherable, but it’s a fun exercise.
