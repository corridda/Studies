"""EXERCISE 4.2. WHO GOES THERE? BOB? IS THAT YOU?
Assume the role of Eve and imagine that you know everything about Alice’s and Bob’s
operation except the private key. That is, suppose you know about the classified ads, the
carrier penguins, and even the encryption program. Their scheme is strengthened by using
asymmetric encryption, but is still vulnerable to an MITM (man-in-the-middle) attack. How can
Eve position herself such that she can trick Alice into sending messages that Eve can decrypt,
and Bob into receiving only false messages from Eve instead of Alice?"""
