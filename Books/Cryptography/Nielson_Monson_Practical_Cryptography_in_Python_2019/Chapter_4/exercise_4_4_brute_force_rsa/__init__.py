"""EXERCISE 4.4. BRUTE-FORCE RSA
Write a program that uses brute force to decrypt an RSA-encrypted word that is all lowercase
(no spaces) and less than four characters. The program should take a public key and the RSA-encrypted
ciphertext as the inputs. Use the RSA encryption program to generate a few words
of four or fewer letters and break these codes with your brute-force program."""
